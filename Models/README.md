Here are the models that we trained:
- autoencoder.tflite is the TFLite version of the NON-quantized autoencoder (trained in the autoencoder_v1.ipynb)
  
- cnn.tflite is the TFLite version of the NON-quantized CNN (trained in the cnn.ipynb)
- cnn.cc is the file containing the binary representation of the non-quantized CNN
  
- quantized_cnn.tflite is the quantized CNN (trained in the cnn.ipynb)
- quantized_cnn.cc contains the binary representation of the quantized CNN
